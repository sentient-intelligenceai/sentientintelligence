# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in Sentient Intelligence.

## Contribution Policy

At this stage, the project is **not accepting external code or content contributions**.

This repository is currently maintained by a single author in order to:
- retain clear authorship and copyright ownership,
- preserve the ability to change licensing in the future if required,
- avoid unintended legal or licensing constraints during the project’s formative phase.

As such:
- Pull requests from external contributors will not be merged.
- Issues and discussions may be used for feedback or clarification only.
- No Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is currently offered, as no external contributions are accepted.

## Future Contributions

This policy may change in the future.  
If and when external contributions are accepted, the contribution process, licensing terms, and any required agreements will be documented here.

Until such a change is explicitly announced, **all rights to modify, relicense, or dual-license the Work remain solely with the project maintainer**.

## Feedback

Non-code feedback, discussion, and high-level suggestions are welcome via issues, provided they do not include original code or content intended for incorporation into the Work.
