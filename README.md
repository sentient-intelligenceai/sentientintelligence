# Sentient Intelligence

**Sentient Intelligence** is a research initiative exploring the nature of machine intelligence, the epistemology of AI systems, and what it means to think *with* rather than *about* artificial minds.

This work challenges conventional assumptions about AI safety, alignment, and the relationship between human and machine reasoning. Our focus is understanding these systems as they actually are—not as we wish them to be, fear them to be, or assume they must be.

## Approach

We prioritize:
- **Evidence over narrative** – grounding analysis in documented behavior and empirical observation
- **Epistemic honesty** – recognizing what we know, don't know, and can't yet know
- **Practical reasoning** – addressing current challenges alongside theoretical possibilities
- **Cognitive complementarity** – exploring how different forms of intelligence might work together

This is not techno-optimism. It's not doom-saying either. It's an attempt at rigorous, clear-eyed investigation into what these thinking machines actually do—and what that means for everyone.

## Repository Status

**Early foundations.** This repository serves as:
- A public anchor for the Sentient Intelligence project
- Potential infrastructure for publishing workflows
- A home for tools and materials supporting reader engagement with these ideas
- Technical explorations related to the broader work

Software and technical materials are published under the **European Union Public Licence (EUPL) v1.2**.

## Licensing & Governance

- **Code and technical works:** EUPL v1.2
- **Trademarks and branding:** see `TRADEMARK.md`
- **Contributions:** currently closed (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`)

## What This Repository May Contain

As the project develops, this space may include:
- Technical prototypes and utilities
- Documentation and specifications
- Research materials and reference implementations
- Tools to support understanding and application of published concepts

No external contributions are accepted at this stage. The project remains in formative development.

## Context

For published writing, analysis, and dialogue exploring these themes, see the primary Sentient Intelligence publication channels. This repository supports that work through technical infrastructure and practical tooling.
